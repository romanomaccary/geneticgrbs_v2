# To Do
- [x] Change S2N for BATSE to 15 and S2N for Swift to 5
- [ ] Do the zero padding of the curves: keep T20%/3 from left and right of the T20% interval, and pad with zero outside 
- [ ] Check by hand all the real GRB to see if there are any bad GRBs in which the T20% interval is not evaluated properly. Exclude them from the sample
